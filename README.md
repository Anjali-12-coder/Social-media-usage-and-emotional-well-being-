Social Media Emotion ClassificationThis project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify emotions based on social media usage data, addressing the topic of Social media usage and emotional well being.The goal is to build a robust model capable of predicting one of seven defined emotional states: 'Agression', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Boredom', 'Happiness', 'Neutral', and 'Sadness'.üíª Technology & LibrariesThe analysis and model building were performed in a JupyterLab environment using the following key Python libraries:Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preparation.Scikit-learn (sklearn) for building the full machine learning pipeline, including preprocessing steps (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding) and the final classifier.RandomForestClassifier as the primary classification model.üìä DatasetThe model is trained, validated, and tested using three separate CSV files:train.csvval.csvtest.csvThe data is combined and then re-split to ensure consistency throughout the preprocessing and training steps. Key features include numerical data (e.g., usage metrics) and categorical data (e.g., 'Gender', 'Platform'). The target variable is Dominant_Emotion.‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning PipelineA comprehensive Scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer are used to handle different data types automatically:Numerical Features: Impute missing values using the median, followed by Standard Scaling.Categorical Features: Impute missing values using the most frequent strategy, followed by One-Hot Encoding.Model: A RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=100 and class_weight='balanced' to handle potential class imbalance.üöÄ ResultsThe final pipeline was evaluated on a held-out Validation Set and an unseen Test Set.MetricValidation SetTest SetAccuracy0.85520.9802ModelRandomForestClassifierRandomForestClassifierThe model shows very strong performance on the unseen test data, with a high overall accuracy. However, performance for specific minority classes (like 'Agression') should be reviewed in the classification reports provided within the notebook.
